# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Practice

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository! This repository contains my journey of learning and implementing various data structures and algorithms, with a focus on honing problem-solving skills and understanding core programming concepts.

## 📘 About the Repository

This repository serves as a collection of my DSA practice exercises, solutions, and notes. It is structured to track my progress as I work through problems, building proficiency in solving algorithmic challenges efficiently.

## 🛠️ Contents

The repository is organized into categories based on types of data structures and algorithms, including but not limited to:

- **Arrays and Strings**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks and Queues**
- **Trees and Graphs**
- **Recursion and Backtracking**
- **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Hashing and Hashmaps**
- **Mathematics and Number Theory**

Each category contains:
- Detailed explanations of concepts.
- Code implementations in C++ (or language of choice).
- Solutions to popular DSA problems from resources like [Striver's A2Z DSA Course](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/) and Apna College.
